With over a decade of experience building products for developers, individuals, managers, and organizational leaders. Code is still how I think best.\n\nI am deeply interested in end-user product development, building products that reach real customers and evolving them through continuous feedback.\n\nOutside of work, you will usually find me tackling ambitious painting projects, 3D printing miniatures, or searching for the next great coffee spot to fuel a mild caffeine dependency.",
