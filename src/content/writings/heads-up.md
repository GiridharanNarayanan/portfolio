For a long time, I've been proud of how head-down I could be.

Not in the performative sense. Not in the "always busy" way. The quieter kind of focus. The kind where attention narrows, context deepens, and the work in front of you holds most of your thinking. That posture suited me, and for a long time, it worked.

My learning followed the same shape.

If something mattered to the outcomes I owned, I learned it. If it helped me shape a product, make a better decision, or stand behind a plan with confidence, I went deep. Reading, conversations, examples from other teams or companies. Everything had a reason. Everything had a destination.

Anything outside that orbit came in more subtly. Interesting ideas. Adjacent developments. Worth noticing, but easy to postpone.

## Depth as a feature, not a flaw

Focus is not accidental in tech and product. It is learned, practiced, and often rewarded.

I leaned into that depth. Ask me about something I built four years ago, and I can still tell you where the edges were. What broke. What surprised us. What tradeoffs we made and why.

Being in the weeds helped me design products at a higher level. It sharpened my judgment and made abstraction honest. That depth also made the transition from individual contributor to engineering manager feel natural. I wasn't stepping away from the work so much as zooming out on it.

Being deeply grounded in the system made it easier to reason about outcomes, not just implementations.

## Where the model started to strain

The need to look beyond immediate work was always there. But it stayed mediated by work itself.

Learning happened when a decision needed more grounding. When a product evolved. When the surface area of responsibility widened. That model worked because the environment was relatively stable.

**That stability is gone.**

AI did not introduce a new topic. It changed the slope.

Every few weeks, something meaningfully different appears. New capabilities. New assumptions. New ways of working. Much of this learning is not emerging from within a single product boundary. It is happening across the ecosystem, in public, and often earlier than expected.

By the time something becomes directly relevant to the work I own, the surrounding conversation may already be well underway.

Staying heads-down by default now carries a different cost.

## Recalibration, not regret

It would be easy to frame this as regret. As if I should have paid attention sooner or learned differently.

That is not how it feels.

The heads-down phase was not a mistake. It built judgment. It created clarity. It made me effective. I still rely on that depth every day.

What changed is not the value of focus, but the environment around it.

**Realizing that has been unexpectedly liberating.**

There is relief in acknowledging that the strategy that worked before does not need to be defended forever. Not because it failed, but because the terrain changed.

---

## Choosing to be more heads-up

Being more heads-up does not mean abandoning focus. It does not mean chasing every new model or idea as it appears.

For me, it means loosening the coupling between learning and immediate utility.

Some learning now needs to happen without a clear outcome attached. Without certainty about when or where it will be applied. The return is slower and less direct, but it compounds differently.

**Looking up is about:**

- Noticing shifts before they surface as decisions
- Building intuition ahead of plans
- Understanding direction, not just execution

In a fast-moving space, that awareness becomes a form of leverage.

## A personal note

This pattern extended beyond work as well.

When most of your energy goes into shaping outcomes and maintaining momentum, everything else becomes quieter by default. Not ignored. Just less prominent.

Lately, I've been creating more space to read differently, observe more broadly, and think without immediately asking how something will be used. That shift has reduced urgency without reducing clarity.

*It feels less like falling behind and more like staying oriented.*

## A heads-up

This shift did not start as a strategy. It started with the simple act of lifting my head and paying attention again.

A heads-up about what was changing around me. About where conversations were happening earlier than before. About ideas forming outside the immediate boundaries of the products and plans I own.

This post is also that. A heads-up that I'll be writing more here. Sharing thoughts, learnings, and observations as I go. Some of it will be directly applicable. Some of it may not be, at least not right away. That is intentional.

If the previous phase was about going deep, this one includes looking up more often. Staying aware while continuing to build. Adjusting posture, not changing direction.

No panic. No pivot. Just a recalibration.

*Heads-up.*
